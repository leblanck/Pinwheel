My name is Kyle LeBlanc - Pinwheel is a (mostly) technical blog dedicated to topics of systems administration/enterprise management in the context of macOS. Frequent topics include installers and packaging, automation tooling, software and OS deployment, MDM, Appleâ€™s command line tools, bash, and Jamf.

The words and views on this blog are my own and do not represent my employer.
