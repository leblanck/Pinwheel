      <description>The website you are reading right now was brought to you with the help of Hugo and Firebase. This combination of tools has allowed me to spin up a live website faster than I ever have before; &amp;lt; 1 hour to a live skeleton site. The free tier of Firebase made it really quick and easy to just pick up and get going, and since it is made by Google, I didn&amp;rsquo;t even need to create a second account.</description>
